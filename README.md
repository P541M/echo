# Echo

Echo is a unique React.js web application that empowers users to express their thoughts freely. Every message shared on Echo echoes throughout the day and then disappears at midnight, providing a fresh canvas each day. Echo ensures your voice is heard, yet transient, fostering a space for authentic and ephemeral expression.
